Decision Tree Classifier for Color Classification
Project Overview
This project implements a decision tree classifier in Java designed to classify the color of a circle based on its spatial location. Utilizing binary decision trees, the classifier was developed as part of the ECSE 250 course assignment during the Fall 2023 term. The main goals included understanding and applying decision trees to solve classification problems, manipulating trees using recursion, and addressing the challenge of overfitting through early stopping criteria.

Key Features
Decision Tree Implementation: Developed a decision tree structure in Java, capable of building the tree based on training data and classifying new data points.
Recursive Tree Manipulation: Employed recursive algorithms to build and traverse the tree, making classification decisions based on node attributes and thresholds.
Overfitting Prevention: Implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Classification Accuracy: Tested the model's accuracy on various datasets, adjusting the minimum size criteria for splitting to explore its impact on overfitting and classification performance.
Technical Details
Language: Java
Key Concepts: Decision Trees, Recursion, Classification, Overfitting
Assignment Tasks: Implemented fillDTNode(), classifyAtNode(), and equals() methods within the DecisionTree.java class as specified in the assignment instructions.
